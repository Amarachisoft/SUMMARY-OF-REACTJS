    <div>
      <h1>ReactJS</h1>
      <h3>
        ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library created by Facebook's
        Jordan Walke to make user interfaces for both web and mobile systems.
        React was first used in 2011 on Facebook's newsfeed. In 2012, it was
        used on Instagram, and in 2013 it was made available to the public.
        React is best for applications that change their data quickly and
        dynamically. It can show the parts of the UI that are changing without
        re-rendering the whole page. This makes the user experience much faster.
      </h3>

      <h1>THE USE OF ReactJS</h1>
      <h3>
        ReactJS is used to handle all of an app's views, whether it's a web app
        or a mobile app. It's also used to reuse user interface (UI) parts.
        ReactJS lets programmers build web apps that can change data without
        reloading the page. The best thing about ReactJS is that it is easy to
        use, and quick. It is also the same as a view in an MVC template. Most
        of the time, it works like a group of JavaScript libraries or
        frameworks. ReactJS's primary goal is to make user interfaces (UI) that
        make apps load faster. It also uses virtual DOM (JavaScript object),
        which also helps the ReactJS app run faster. In JavaScript, the virtual
        DOM is faster than the real DOM. ReactJS can be used on both the server
        and client-server sides, as well as with other frameworks. It uses data
        patterns and components to make the code easier to read and make app
        maintenance easier.

        <h1>The Main Features of ReactJS</h1>
        <h3>
          ReactJS is one of the greatest JavaScript frameworks for web
          developers, as it plays an important part in the front-end ecosystem.
          The following are the main features of ReactJS:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension):It is a syntax extension for
            JavaScript. ReactJS uses an XML or HTML-like syntax. The syntax is
            turned into React Framework JavaScript calls.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Virtual DOM:</span>DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is
            the most crucial aspect of web development since it splits the code
            into modules and then executes it. JavaScript frameworks typically
            update the entire DOM at once, making the online app slow. However,
            React makes use of virtual DOM, which is a carbon replica of real
            DOM.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>One-way Data Binding: </span>. In React, data only goes in one
            direction, from top to bottom, from parent components to child
            components. The child component's properties (props) cannot return
            data to its parent component, but they can communicate with it to
            change the states based on the inputs. One-way data-binding operates
            in this manner
          </li>
          <span>Declarative: </span
          >ReactJS uses simple JavaScript to enable a component-based approach
          to develop websites and mobile apps, which has the benefit of cutting
          development costs. The best features of ReactJS enable web pages and
          mobile apps to have highly interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
          <li>
            <span>React Native:</span>Instead of using web components like
            React, React Native employs native components as building blocks. To
            get started with React Native, you'll need to understand basic React
            concepts like JSX, components, state, and props.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Component-Based:</span>Each visual part of the software is
            encapsulated within a component, which is a self-contained module.
            ReactJS components are the building blocks of any React application
            and are one of the best features in ReactJS, and a single app is
            typically built of numerous components. A user interface element is
            essentially the most significant component.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>
          <span>The Components Of ReactJS:</span>
          A component is one of React's fundamental elements. In other words,
          each React application you build will be composed of components.
          Components make creating user interfaces considerably easier. You can
          divide a user interface into components and work on them individually
          before combining them into a parent component, which will be your
          final UI.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          There are two sorts of components: Function components and Class
          components.
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Functional Components:</span>When dealing with React,
            functional components are some of the most popular components you'll
            By writing a JavaScript function, we can create a functional
            component for React. come across.The return value in functional
            Components is the JSX code to render to the DOM tree.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Class Functions:</span>The class components are more difficult
            to understand than the functional components. Your program's
            functional components are oblivious of each other, whereas the class
            components can collaborate. To create class-based components in
            React, we can use JavaScript ES6 classes. Information can be sent
            from one class component to another.

        <h1>ReactJS components interaction:</h1>
        <p>
          Every React app is made up of parts that work together. An important
          part of the UI architecture is how these parts talk to each other.
          Component interactions become even more important as apps get bigger
          and more complicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          React has several ways to handle this need, and each has its own use
          cases.

          React has several ways to handle this need, and each has its own use
          cases.
          <li>
            <span>Parent-to-child with props: </span>
            Properties, often called "props," are the easiest way for components
            to talk to each other. Props are the arguments that a parent
            component sends to a child component.
          </li>
          <li><span>Child to Parents with Functional Props:</span>If you try to change a child's prop directly, you'll get the following error message in the console:

            Uncaught TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'foo' of object '#<Object>'</li>
                <li>
                    <span>Telling parents about something:</span>A lot of the time, child components need to send arguments up with their events. Adding arguments to the functional prop callback will let you do this.
                </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>ReactJS Lifecycle Methods</h1>
        <ul>A React Component can go through the four stages listed below:
            <li>Initialization: This is when the component is made with the given Props and default state. This is done in a Component Class's function Object() { [native code] }.</li>
            <li>Mounting: This is the rendering stage of the JSX returned by the method itself.</li>
            <li>Updating: This is the stage when the state of a component is updated and repaints the application.</li>
            <li>Unmounting: The final step in the component lifecycle is unmounting, which removes the component from the page.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">ReactJS Lifecycle Hooks:</h1>
        <p>Hooks are a new feature in React 16.8. They enable the use of state, and other React features without building a class. </p>
        <p><span>State Hook:</span>This function can be called from an event handler, or from anywhere else. This is comparable, except that setState in a class does not combine the old and new states.</p>
        <p><span>Effect Hooks:</span>The useEffect Effect Hook gives a function component the ability to perform side effects. It accomplishes the same thing as React's componentDidUpdate, componentDidMount, and componentWillUnmount methods, but in a single API.
